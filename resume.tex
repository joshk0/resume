\section{EXPERIENCE}
\textit{Co-founder and CTO} \hfill June 2020 - present \\
\textbf{Ternary Inc.}

  Developing software to help engineering and finance work together to
  save money in the cloud. Fully responsible for engineering work and
  buildout of engineering organization. Participant in other executive
  work and fundraising.

\textit{Senior Software Engineer, DevOps} \hfill November 2016 - June 2020 \\
\textbf{LiveRamp Holdings, New York, NY (formerly Acxiom Corporation)}

  After Arbor was acquired by LiveRamp, led and managed 6+ engineers in
  the DevOps team. Successfully led this team over 18 months to fully
  migrate LiveRamp's environment from on-prem datacenter to Google Cloud
  Platform. The migration of 90PB of data and 90,000 cores of data
  processing workloads began in June of 2018 and concluded in November
  2019 with zero downtime by customers.

  Used the migration as a wedge to improve LiveRamp's SDLC by fully
  containerizing our US production environment. Worked cross-functionally
  to implement improved security, governance and cost control processes.
  Mediated between technical and non-technical teams to find right balance
  of developer ownership, risk avoidance, and speed of product delivery.

\textit{Senior Software Engineer} \hfill May 2015 - November 2016 \\
\textbf{Arbor Technologies, New York, NY}

  First technical non-founder at small digital advertising startup.
  Provided leadership and ownership in the design of a data platform for
  receiving, storing, and distributing customer data. Webscaled, highly
  available Go codebase deployment on Google Cloud Platform receives
  over 10,000 RPS.

\textit{Senior Infrastructure Engineer} \hfill January 2014 - May 2015 \\
\textbf{Schrodinger, Inc., New York, NY}

  Scaled cloud infrastructure (AWS, VMware) to support LiveDesign, a
  unique collaborative drug design product. Brought legacy Java codebase
  up to date with modern CI/CD practices. Automated deployments of
  LiveDesign at customer sites using Chef.

\textit{Member / Senior Member of Technical Staff} \hfill January 2009 - December 2013 \\
\textbf{VMware, Inc., Palo Alto, CA}

  \textbf{Horizon View HTML Access:} HTML Access provides browser-based
  connectivity to a Horizon View virtual desktop. Leveraged HTML5 to
  provide a smooth desktop experience even under network load and
  latency across most modern desktop and mobile browsers. Wrote RESTful
  APIs, dug into Windows' Terminal Services APIs, and maintained several
  installers surrounding the feature.

  \textbf{Horizon View Seamless Windows:} A port (80\% reuse) of the
  `Unity' feature from VMware's consumer products to Horizon View.
  Seamless Windows removes the background from a user's View virtual
  desktop so that the Windows appear seamlessly alongside the user's
  other applications. They can be resized and dragged natively. The
  port involved challenges such as cross-browser functionality and
  higher latencies over the network.

  \textbf{ThinApp Factory:} Developed a product to help automate
  creation of ThinApp packages (virtualized applications for Windows) at
  a large scale. Helped build a virtual appliance which used Debian,
  Java and the vSphere API to create and maintain ThinApps using a
  continuous integration process. The product has since been
  open-sourced and is available at
  \faIcon{github}
  \href{https://github.com/vmware/thinapp\_factory}{vmware/thinapp\_factory}.

  \textbf{Component Download Service (CDS):} Co-designed and implemented
  client and server APIs in C which allow delivery of software updates for
  all VMware products, built on top of cURL and OpenSSL. Added specific
  functionality for Windows, Linux and OS X. Products using CDS were
  first relesed in October 2009 and the framework is still used today
  (as of September 2020.)

\textit{Network Manager} \hfill August 2007 - January 2008 \\
\textbf{Berkeley Student Cooperative, Berkeley, CA}

  Managed internal network infrastructure, firewall, routing
  software, Internet connectivity, and data storage for a house of 120 residents.
  Responsibilities include tasks from low-level (running Ethernet)
  to high-level (managing network QoS and traffic-shaping in Linux.)

\textit{Intern} \hfill Summer 2007 \\
\textbf{VMware, Inc., Palo Alto, CA}

  \textbf{Linux Easy Install}: Developed Linux support for the Easy
  Install feature, which allows a user to provide ISO or CD media of
  a Linux distribution and automatically installs it into a blank VM
  without user input. At the time I left, 5 distributions were supported.

\textit{Volunteer Developer} \hfill 2003 - \textit{present} \\
\textbf{\href{https://www.debian.org}{The Debian Project}, worldwide}

  Assembled and maintained software packages for the Debian GNU/Linux
  distribution, involving knowledge of Make, shell, C, and Perl. Added
  the ability to configure and use a wireless adapter during installation.
