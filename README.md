# Josh's Resume

I wrote my resume in LaTeX! A nice tradition to keep in these modern days of WYSIWYG editors.

The latest PDF version can be found by digging around in the artifacts of the CircleCI build above.
You can also check this repo out and run `make` on any machine with the full LaTeX distribution.
